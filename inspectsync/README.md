## 🎨 Design System

InspectSync implements a **dual-mode design system** called the **"Tactical Architect"** specification:

### Light Mode
- Clean, high-contrast surfaces (`#F8FAFB` base)
- Tonal layering with no visible 1px borders
- Primary blue accent (`#005BBF`)
- Large touch targets (min 48dp)

### Dark Mode — "Obsidian Command"
- Deep navy surfaces (`#060E20` base)
- Softened blue primary (`#6B92ED`) for reduced eye strain
- Elevated tonal separation through opacity-based card hierarchy
- Suitable for low-light field environments

### Key Design Tokens
- **Fonts**: Manrope (headings), Inter (body)
- **Corner Radius**: 8px inputs, 12px cards, 16px sections, 20px modals
- **Elevation**: Zero shadow philosophy — separation through color contrast only
- **All screens are theme-aware** and render correctly in both Light and Dark modes

---

## 🔄 Offline Sync Engine

The sync system is the core technical innovation of InspectSync. It follows an **optimistic offline-first** pattern:

### Data Flow

```
User Action → Local DB Write → Sync Queue Entry → Background Sync → Server
                                                       ↓
                                                  Conflict Check
                                                     ↓    ↓
                                              No Conflict  Conflict Detected
                                                  ↓              ↓
                                           Mark Synced    Create Conflict Record
                                                              ↓
                                                    User Resolves via UI
```

### Key Components

1. **SyncQueueManager**: Manages a FIFO queue of pending changes in SQLite. Each entry tracks entity type, entity ID, action (create/update), payload, status, and retry count.

2. **SyncService**: The orchestrator that:
   - Reads the pending queue
   - Pushes changes to the remote datasource
   - Fetches latest server state for conflict detection
   - Emits real-time `SyncProgress` via a broadcast stream

3. **ConflictResolver**: Compares local and server payloads field-by-field. When a difference is detected, it creates a `Conflict` record in the database with both versions for user resolution.

4. **SyncController** (ChangeNotifier): The state manager that:
   - Listens to `SyncService.progressStream` for real-time operation updates.
   - **Reactive Queue**: Subscribes to the `SyncQueue` database stream to show pending items immediately (even offline).
   - **Telemetry**: Calculates real disk usage of the local database.
   - **Persistence**: Exposes the last successful sync time from shared preferences.
   - Blocks sync attempts when the device is "Logically Offline" (Manual Mode).

### Database Schema

| Table | Fields | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **Tasks** | id, title, description, lat, lng, status, version, isSynced, updatedAt, createdAt | Core task data |
| **SyncQueue** | id, entityType, entityId, action, payload, status, retryCount, createdAt | Offline change queue |
| **Conflicts** | id, entityId, entityType, localData, serverData, status, createdAt | Unresolved merge conflicts |

## 🌐 Real Connectivity Monitoring

InspectSync implements a **two-layer connectivity verification** system:

| Layer | Mechanism | Speed | Accuracy | Note |
|-------|-----------|-------|----------|------|
| **Layer 1** | `connectivity_plus` | Instant | Medium | Detects physical radio state (WiFi/Mobile) |
| **Layer 2** | `InternetAddress.lookup` | ~1-5 sec | High | Verifies actual DNS reachability |
| **Layer 3** | **Signal Integrity** | Real-time | High | Measures **Latency (ms)** and **Mbps** |
| **Layer 4** | **Manual Toggle** | Instant | Perfect | User-defined "Offline Mode" override |

### Behavior

- **Periodic polling**: Background recheck every 30 seconds
- **Instant response**: Layer 1 events trigger immediate Layer 2 verification
- **Auto-sync on reconnect**: When connectivity is restored and pending items exist, sync triggers automatically
- **UI feedback**: Dashboard status header, sync screen badge, and offline banners all react in real-time via `ChangeNotifier`

---

## 🧭 Navigation Architecture

All navigation is managed through **GoRouter** with the following route table:

| Route | Screen | Type |
|-------|--------|------|
| `/` | LoginScreen | Root (Guard-protected) |
| `/dashboard` | MainScreen (with BottomAppBar shell) | Authenticated root |
| `/profile` | ProfileScreen | Full-screen push |
| `/sync` | SyncStatusScreen | Full-screen push |
| `/sync/conflict/:id` | ConflictResolutionScreen | Full-screen push (with `extra` data) |
| `/task-details` | TaskDetailsScreen | Full-screen push |
| `/create-task` | CreateTaskScreen | Full-screen push |

### Bottom Navigation Tabs (inside `/dashboard`)

| Index | Icon | Label | Behavior |
|-------|------|-------|----------|
| 0 | Dashboard | DASHBOARD | IndexedStack tab |
| 1 | Map | MAP | IndexedStack tab |
| 2 | Tasks | TASKS | IndexedStack tab |
| 3 | Sync | SYNC | Redirects to `/sync` (full-screen push) |

The FAB (center-docked `+` button) navigates to `/create-task`.

---

## 🌍 Localization

The app uses Flutter's official `flutter_localizations` framework with ARB files:

- **Current locales**: English (`en`)
- **Translation file**: `lib/l10n/app_en.arb`
- **Coverage**: Dashboard labels, navigation labels, sync status messages, task field labels, velocity metrics, system messages
- **Parameterized messages**: Supports plurals and variable interpolation (e.g., `taskUnitsRemaining(count)`, `systemHealthy(count)`)
